    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This caffeinated concoction makes for a sweet treat to start the day with. This is an incredibly simple recipe that requires minimal time and ingredients. Note that I prefer to do this with espresso however you  can also use a French press or Moka pot to prepare your coffee.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Double shot of espresso</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp of brown sugar</li>

        <li>1/4 cup milk of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all your ingredients, minus the milk, in a glass jar. Shake vigorously.</li>
        <li>Once your mix is frothy, pour into a drinking glass with a little additional ice and then pour  your milk of choice.</li>
